**Project Introduction: Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis**

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis project! This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the sales patterns and trends of a coffee shop, helping to optimize operations and enhance profitability. We addressed several key questions to understand various aspects of sales performance.

**Problem Statement:**

Despite having a wealth of sales data, the shop lacks clear insights into several critical areas that impact its operations and profitability.

**About the Dataset:**

This project's data was obtained from the Maven Analytics and a coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details. The data contains 11 columns and 149,116 rows.
