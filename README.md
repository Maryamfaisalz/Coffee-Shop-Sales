Project Introduction: Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis
Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis project! This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the sales patterns and trends of a coffee shop, helping to optimize operations and enhance profitability. We addressed several key questions to understand various aspects of sales performance.

Questions: 
How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
Are there any peak times for sales activity?
What is the total sales revenue for each month?
How do sales vary across different store locations?
What is the average price/order per person?
Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
How do sales vary by product category and type?
