**Project Introduction: Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis**

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis project! This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the sales patterns and trends of a coffee shop, helping to optimize operations and enhance profitability. We addressed several key questions to understand various aspects of sales performance.

**Problem Statement:**


The coffee shop is seeking to enhance its understanding of sales patterns and trends to make informed decisions that will drive growth and improve customer satisfaction. Despite having a wealth of sales data, the shop lacks clear insights into several critical areas that impact its operations and profitability.

**About Data:**

This project's data was obtained from the Maven Analytics and a coffee shop operating out of three NYC locations. Dataset includes the transaction date, timestamp and location, along with product-level details. The data contains 11 columns and 149,116 rows.

| Column        | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| transaction_id  | Unique sequential ID representing an individual transaction  |
| transaction_date  | Date of the transaction (MM/DD/YY)  |
| transaction_time | Timestamp of the transaction (HH:MM:SS)  |
| transaction_qty | Quantity of items sold |
| product_id  | Unique ID of the product sold |
| product_type | Description of the product type  |
| product_detail | Description of the product detail  |

| store_id  | Unique ID of the coffee shop where the transaction took place  |
| store_location | Location of the coffee shop where the transaction took place  |
|unit_price | Retail price of the product sold  |

**Questions:** 
1) How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
2) Are there any peak times for sales activity?
3) What is the total sales revenue for each month?
4) How do sales vary across different store locations?
5) What is the average price/order per person?
6) Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
7) How do sales vary by product category and type?

**Objectives:**
1) Identify Peak Sales Periods: Determine the busiest times of the day and week to optimize staffing and stock levels. 
2) Monthly Revenue Analysis: Analyze monthly sales to identify trends and seasonality, aiding in financial planning and forecasting.
3) Location Performance: Compare sales across different store locations to identify high and low-performing branches. 
4) Product Insights: Understand which products drive the most sales and revenue to inform inventory and promotional strategies. 
5) Customer Behavior: Analyze average order values to better understand customer spending habits.
